Passive reconnaissance is an attempt to gain information about targeted computers and networks **without actively engaging with the systems.**
In active reconnaissance, in contrast, the attacker engages with the target system, typically conducting a **port scan** to determine find any open ports.

**The term reconnaissance comes from its military use to describe an information-gathering mission.**
Both types of reconnaissance are sometimes referred to as passive attacks because the purpose is simply to obtain information, rather than to actively exploit the target.
However, reconnaissance is often a preliminary step towards an active attempt to exploit the target system.

- make sure you're attacking the right targets, within scope
- expand your surface
- know what kind of target it is, what do they have running in it
- heavy on data breaches: most common way to get in

**E-mail OSINT (discovering, find and verify people)**
*result can be a list of names, usrs, emails and pwds*
username pattern is important
use pwd recovery for validating, get info using "forgot" methods without providing input (email, recovery email, phone no.)

hunting breached credentials:
hunter.io: search emails by domain / company name
phonebook.cz: email/domain/url discovery
clearbit connect: chrome extension to find emails
tools.verifyemailaddress.io: verify valid emails existence (has APIs)

parse through specific breach file > https://github.com/hmaverickadams/breach-parse
usr pattern changes
repeat offenders (repeated entries, usr or pwd)

profiling:
dehashed.com (paywalled) many filters for search, relating accounts, tying data together
focus on patterns for data pivoting, tie down stuff
tie ips to location
hashes.org: search via hash

web info gathering > hunting subdomains:
identify "hidden"/additional resources/targets on the scope

sublist3r: wide repositories search
crt.sh: certificate fingerprinting
owasp amass ⭐️ (takes a long time)

gather info, versions to lookup vulnerabilities & exploits

Burp suite: web proxy for intercepting traffic from/to a website
need to setup proxy in web browser settings

use response data (headers) for info: versions, server naming patterns

use google fu to discover resources (domains, sensitive files)
use social media: linkedin, twitter > pictures for stuff, people names (usr/emails)
