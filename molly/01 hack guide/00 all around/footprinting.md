`case the joint`
To observe a place in order to familiarize oneself with its workings in preparation for some criminal activity (often robbery)

aka "reconnaissance"
footprinting is passive, or nonintrusive; in other words, you aren’t accessing information illegally or gathering unauthorized informa- tion with false credentials.

attackers check Web pages and newsgroups, examine IP addresses of companies, and look for postings from IT personnel asking questions about OSs or firewall configurations. Remember that after gathering a piece of information, you shouldn’t stop there. Continue to dig to see what else potential attackers could discover.

this infor- mation gathering, called competitive intelligence, is done on an even higher level through technology

is time consuming, and the more you find out, the deeper you want to dig. Setting a reason- able time frame for this phase of your investigation is important, or you might spend too much time on this activity.

Based on an e-mail account listed in DNS output, you might discover that the company’s  
e-mail address format is first name initial, followed by last name and the @companyname.com 4 sequence. You can guess other employees’ e-mail accounts by getting a company phone directory or searching the Internet for any @companyname.com references.
