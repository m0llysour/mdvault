OSI (open systems interconnection)
model, layers which encapsulate adding information
7- application
6- presentation
5- session
4- transport
3- network
2- data link
1- physical

7- the application layer is the layer in which protocols and rules are in place to determine how the user should interact with data sent or received (browser, filezilla, dns). **user interfaces** live here

6- standardisation starts to take place. Because software developers can develop any software such as an email client differently, the data still needs to be handled in the same way — no matter how the software works.
This layer acts as a **translator** for data to and from the application layer (layer 7). The receiving computer will also understand data sent to a computer in one format destined for in another format. For example, when you send an email, the other user may have another email client to you, but the contents of the email will still need to display the same.
Security features such as data encryption (like HTTPS when visiting a secure site) occur at this layer

5- Once data has been correctly translated or formatted from the presentation layer (layer 6), the session layer (layer 5) will begin to create a connection to the other computer that the data is destined for. **When a connection is established, a session is created. Whilst this connection is active, so is the session.**
The session layer (layer 5) synchronises the two computers to ensure that they are on the same page before data is sent and received. Once these checks are in place, the session layer will begin to **divide up the data sent into smaller chunks of data and begin to send these chunks (packets) one at a time.** 

4- Layer 4 of the OSI model plays a vital part in transmitting data across a network and can be a little bit difficult to grasp. When data is sent between devices, it follows one of two different protocols that are decided based upon several factors: TCP / UDP

3- The third layer of the OSI model (network layer) is where the magic of routing & re-assembly of data takes place (from these small chunks to the larger chunk). Firstly, routing simply determines the most optimal path in which these chunks of data should be sent.

Whilst some protocols at this layer determine exactly what is the "optimal" path that data should take to reach a device, we should only know about their existence at this stage of the networking module. Briefly, these protocols include **OSPF** (**O**pen **S**hortest **P**ath **F**irst) and **RIP** (**R**outing **I**nformation **P**rotocol). The factors that decide what route is taken is decided by the following:

-   What path is the shortest? I.e. has the least amount of devices that the packet needs to travel across.
-   What path is the most reliable? I.e. have packets been lost on that path before?
-   Which path has the faster physical connection? I.e. is one path using a copper connection (slower) or a fibre (considerably faster)?

At this layer, everything is dealt with via IP addresses such as 192.168.1.100. Devices such as routers capable of delivering packets using IP addresses are known as Layer 3 devices — because they are capable of working at the third layer of the OSI model.

2- The data link layer focuses on the physical addressing of the transmission. It receives a packet from the network layer (including the IP address for the remote computer) and adds in the physical **MAC** (Media Access Control) address of the receiving endpoint. Inside every network-enabled computer is a **N**etwork **I**nterface Card (**NIC**) which comes with a unique MAC address to identify it.

MAC addresses are set by the manufacturer and literally burnt into the card; they can't be changed -- although they can be spoofed. When information is sent across a network, it's actually the physical address that is used to identify where exactly to send the information.

Additionally, it's also the job of the data link layer to present the data in a format suitable for transmission.

1- This layer is one of the easiest layers to grasp. Put simply, this layer references the physical components of the hardware used in networking and is the lowest layer that you will find. Devices use electrical signals to transfer data between each other in a binary numbering system (1's and 0's).
