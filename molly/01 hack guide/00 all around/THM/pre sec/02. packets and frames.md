Packets and frames are small pieces of data that, when forming together, make a larger piece of information or message. However, they are two different things in the OSI model. A frame is at layer 2 - the data link layer, meaning there is no such information as IP addresses.

This process is called encapsulation. 
At this stage, it's safe to assume that when we are talking about anything IP addresses, we are talking about packets. When the encapsulating information is stripped away, we're talking about the frame itself

TCP/IP protocol layers:
-   Application
-   Transport
-   Internet
-   Network Interface
information is added to each layer of the TCP model as the piece of data (or packet) traverses it. this is encapsulation - where the reverse of this process is decapsulation

One defining feature of TCP is that it is **connection-based**, which means that TCP must establish a connection between both a client and a device acting as a server **before** data is sent.

3 way handshake

1.  SYN - Client: Here's my Initial Sequence Number(ISN) to SYNchronise with (0)
2.  SYN/ACK - Server: Here's my Initial Sequence Number (ISN) to SYNchronise with (5,000), and I ACKnowledge your initial number sequence (0)
3.  ACK - Client: I ACKnowledge your Initial Sequence Number (ISN) of (5,000), here is some data that is my ISN+1 (5,000 + 1)

Unlike its brother TCP, UDP is a **stateless** protocol that doesn't require a constant connection between the two devices for data to be sent. For example, the Three-way handshake does not occur, nor is there any synchronisation between the two devices.

Perhaps aptly titled by their name, ports are an essential point in which data can be exchanged. Think of a harbour and port. Ships wishing to dock at the harbour will have to go to a port compatible with the dimensions and the facilities located on the ship. When the ship lines up, it will connect to a **port** at the harbour. Take, for instance, that a cruise liner cannot dock at a port made for a fishing vessel and vice versa.
 Any port that is within **0** and **1024** (1,024) is known as a common port
