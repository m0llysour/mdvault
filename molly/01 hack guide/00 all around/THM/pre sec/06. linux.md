**processes**
Let's start off by talking about namespaces. The Operating System (OS) uses namespaces to ultimately split up the resources available on the computer to (such as CPU, RAM and priority) processes. Think of it as splitting your computer up into slices -- similar to a cake. Processes within that slice will have access to a certain amount of computing power, however, it will be a small portion of what is actually available to every process overall.
Namespaces are great for security as it is a way of isolating processes from another -- only those that are in the same namespace will be able to see each other.

once a system boots and it initialises, **systemd** is one of the first processes that are started. Any program or piece of software that we want to start will start as what's known as a child process of **systemd**.

systemctl start/enable apache2

 we can use `Ctrl + Z` on our keyboard to background a process
 we can use `fg` to bring this back to focus

Additional repositories can be added by using the `add-apt-repository`command or by listing another provider! For example, some vendors will have a repository that is closer to their geographical location.
