Defence in Depth is the use of multiple varied layers of security to an organisation's systems and data in the hopes that multiple layers will provide redundancy in an organisation's security perimeter.

Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) is the opposite of Disclosure, Alternation, and Destruction (DAD).
If a security policy does not answer these three sections, it is seldom an effective security policy.

**Confidentiality** - This element is the protection of data from unauthorized access and misuse. Organisations will always have some form of sensitive data stored on their systems. To provide confidentiality is to protect this data from parties that it is not intended for.
**Integrity** - The CIA triad element of integrity is the condition where information is kept accurate and consistent unless authorized changes are made. It is possible for the information to change because of careless access and use, errors in the information system, or unauthorized access and use. In the CIA triad, integrity is maintained when the information remains unchanged during storage, transmission, and usage not involving modification to the information. Steps must be taken to ensure data cannot be altered by unauthorised people (for example, in a breach of confidentiality).
**Availability** - In order for data to be useful, it must be available and accessible by the user.
The main concern in the CIA triad is that the information should be available when authorised users need to access it.

privileges
The levels of access given to individuals are determined on two primary factors:
-   The individual's role/function within the organisation
-   The sensitivity of the information being stored on the system

Two key concepts are used to assign and manage the access rights of individuals, two key concepts are used: Privileged Identity Management (PIM) and Privileged Access Management (or PAM for short).
PIM is used to translate a user's role within an organisation into an access role on a system. Whereas PAM is the management of the privileges a system's access role has, amongst other things.
PAM incorporates more than assigning access. It also encompasses enforcing security policies such as password management, auditing policies and reducing the attack surface a system faces.
Simply, users should be given the minimum amount of privileges, and only those that are absolutely necessary for them to perform their duties.

According to a security model, any system or piece of technology storing information is called an information system

Threat modelling is the process of reviewing, improving, and testing the security protocols in place in an organisation's information technology infrastructure and services.
A critical stage of the threat modelling process is identifying likely threats that an application or system may face, the vulnerabilities a system or application may be vulnerable to.
-   Preparation
-   Identification
-   Mitigations
-   Review
An effective threat model includes:
-   Threat intelligence
-   Asset identification
-   Mitigation capabilities
-   Risk assessment
there are frameworks such as **STRIDE** (**S**poofing identity, **T**ampering with data, **R**epudiation threats, **I**nformation disclosure, **D**enial of Service and **E**levation of privileges) and **PASTA** (**P**rocess for **A**ttack **S**imulation and **T**hreat **A**nalysis)

A breach of security is known as an incident. And despite all rigorous threat models and secure system designs, incidents do happen. Actions taken to resolve and remediate the threat are known as Incident Response (IR) and are a whole career path in cybersecurity.
Incidents are classified using a rating of urgency and impact. Urgency will be determined by the type of attack faced, where the impact will be determined by the affected system and what impact that has on business operations.
urgency/impact: low/mid/high, combined

An incident is responded to by a **C**omputer **S**ecurity **I**ncident **R**esponse **T**eam (**CSIRT**) > Preparation, Identification, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, Lessons Learned
