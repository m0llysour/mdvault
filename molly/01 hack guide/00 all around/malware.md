A shell is an executable piece of programming code that creates an interface to an OS for issuing system commands and shouldn’t appear in an e-mail attachment

A worm is a program that replicates and propagates itself without having to attach itself to a host (unlike a virus, which needs to attach itself to a host).
Theoretically, a worm that repli- cates itself multiple times to every user it infects can infect every computer in the world over a short period.

Trojan programs, which disguise themselves as useful programs and can install a backdoor or rootkit on a computer. Backdoors or rootkits are programs that give attackers a means of regaining access to the attacked computer later. A rootkit is created after an attack and usually hides itself in the OS tools, so it’s almost impossible to detect.

A spyware program sends information from the infected computer to the person who initi- ated the spyware program on your computer.

In a buffer overflow attack, a programmer finds a vulnerability in poorly written code that doesn’t check for a defined amount of memory space

Session hijacking enables an attacker to join a TCP session and make both parties think he or she is the other party.

By identifying all the vulnerabilities associated with a customer’s OSs and applications, you can determine which type of attack to use on a network when conducting a security test. You might also discover a vulnerability associated with a different OS that could be used to com- promise your client’s OS. Remember to think outside the box. Security testing is more than memorizing tools and rules; it relies heavily on creativity and imagination.
